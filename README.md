# Data Science Portfolio

### Data Visualization Projects:
* [Data Visualization with Matplotlib](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/data%20viz%20with%20matplotlib/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb):
In this project, I discuss Matplotlib (the basic plotting library in Python) and throw some light on various charts and customization techniques associated with it.I discuss various types of plots like line plot, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, pie chart, box plot and area chart.Finally, I discuss various customization techniques. I discuss how to customize the graphics with styles. I discuss how to add a grid and how to handle axes and ticks. I discuss how to add labels, title and legend. I discuss how to customize the charts with colours and line styles.

* [Data Visualization with Seaborn](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/data%20viz%20with%20seaborn/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Seaborn.ipynb):
For this project, I have used Penguin dataset available on kaggle.I plot univariate distribution with distplot() function. Then, I discuss histogram and kernel density estimation plots. I plot bivariate distribution with jointplot() function and discuss Seaborn scatter plot.Then, I plot categorical data with Seaborn strip plot and swarm plot. I visualize the distribution of observations with Seaborn box plot and violin plot. I measure the statistical estimates with Seaborn bar plot and point plot.I visualize the linear relationships between variables with Seaborn reg plot and lm plot.I discuss Seaborn heat map and cluster map.I discuss facet grid and I visualize pairwise relationship with pairplot() function.

* [Pandas In-built Data Visualization](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/pandas%20in-built%20data%20viz/Pandas%20in-built%20data%20visualization.ipynb):
In this project, I discuss various in-built visualization techniques in pandas library. I plot scatter plot, histogram, box plot, kde plot, density plot and area plot using pandas.

* [Interactive visualization with Plotly and Cufflinks](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/plotly%20and%20cufflinks/Plotly%20and%20Cufflinks.ipynb):
Plotly is a library that allows to create interactive plots that can be used in dashboards or websites.I plot some basic plotly interactive charts in this project.
