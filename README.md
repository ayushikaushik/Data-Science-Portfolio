# Data Science Portfolio

### [Regression Project](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Regression%20Project/Regression-all-models.ipynb):
I have used [Avacado Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices) from Kaggle in this project. I applied **linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machines and xgboost** algorithms using scikit-learn library to predict prices of avacado. Using TensorFlow2.0, I created a **deep neural network** of depth 3. For this dataset, XGBoost gave least mean absolute error and maximum R-squared of 0.89.

### [Classification Project 1](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Classification%20Project/Classification%20Project.ipynb):
I have used [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) from Kaggle. Based on some health conditions of an individual my model will predict whether he has any cardiovascular disease or not. After data cleaning, I applied **logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and support vector machines** algorithms using scikit-learn library to predict presence of the disease. Using TensorFlow2.0, I created a **deep neural network** of depth 3. After using **GridSearchCV**, I improved accuracy in Random Forest model. I achieved best accuracy of 74%.

### [Classification Project 2](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/over-sampling-and-6-classification-algorithms.ipynb):
In this project, I have used [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset from Kaggle. This was a highly **unbalanced dataset**. I downsampled the majority class to make this dataset balanced. Then, I applied machine learning algorithms to separate fraud and nn-fraud cases.

### [Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Analysis%20Project/placement-dataanalysis-classification-regression.ipynb):
I have used [Campus Recruitment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement) from Kaggle. I did detailed exploratory anaysis on each feature. Then, I created a classification and regression task from the dataset and applied ML algorithms to solve them.

### [Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20Project/Linear%20Regression%20Project.ipynb):
For this project, I have used [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) available on kaggle. I have applied linear regression model using both sklearn and statsmodel libraries. Model using Sklearn gave R2 score of 79% and one using Statsmodel gave R-squared equal to 0.98.

### [Logistic Regression Project](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Project/Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb):
For this project, I have used [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression) available on Kaggle to predict heart disease using logistic model. My model accuracy is 86.5%.


### Data Visualization Projects:
* [Data Visualization with Matplotlib](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/data%20viz%20with%20matplotlib/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb):
In this project, I discuss Matplotlib (the basic plotting library in Python) and throw some light on various charts and customization techniques associated with it. I discuss various types of plots like line plot, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, pie chart, box plot and area chart.Finally, I discuss various customization techniques. I discuss how to customize the graphics with styles. I discuss how to add a grid and how to handle axes and ticks. I discuss how to add labels, title and legend. I discuss how to customize the charts with colours and line styles.

* [Data Visualization with Seaborn](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/data%20viz%20with%20seaborn/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Seaborn.ipynb):
For this project, I have used [Penguin dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) available on kaggle. I plot univariate distribution with distplot() function. Then, I discuss histogram and kernel density estimation plots. I plot bivariate distribution with jointplot() function and discuss Seaborn scatter plot.Then, I plot categorical data with Seaborn strip plot and swarm plot. I visualize the distribution of observations with Seaborn box plot and violin plot. I measure the statistical estimates with Seaborn bar plot and point plot. I visualize the linear relationships between variables with Seaborn reg plot and lm plot. I discuss Seaborn heat map, cluster map and facet grid and pairwise relationship with pairplot() function.

* [Pandas In-built Data Visualization](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/pandas%20in-built%20data%20viz/Pandas%20in-built%20data%20visualization.ipynb):
In this project, I discuss various in-built visualization techniques in pandas library. I plot scatter plot, histogram, box plot, kde plot, density plot and area plot using pandas.

* [Interactive visualization with Plotly and Cufflinks](https://github.com/ayushikaushik/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/plotly%20and%20cufflinks/Plotly%20and%20Cufflinks.ipynb):
Plotly is a library that allows to create interactive plots that can be used in dashboards or websites.I plot some basic plotly interactive charts in this project.
